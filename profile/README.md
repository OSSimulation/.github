[![The OS Simulation Project](https://github.com/OSSimulation/.github/blob/master/THEOSSIMULATIONPROJECT_LOWRES.png?raw=true)](https://ossimulation.github.io/)
The OS Simulation Project was a project where we made Roblox games that simulated discontinued operating systems, while trying to be as accurate to the original as possible. This GitHub organisation was for our open-source projects.

Our Roblox games our now open-source and can now be downloaded and edited at their respected game links, which you can find at our Roblox Group.
