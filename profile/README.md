[![The OS Simulation Project](https://github.com/OSSimulation/.github/blob/master/THEOSSIMULATIONPROJECT_LOWRES.png?raw=true)](https://os.thomasluigi07.com/)
The OS Simulation Project is a project where we make Unity games (and used to make Roblox games) that simulates discontinued operating systems, while trying to be as accurate to the original as possible. This GitHub organisation is for our open-source projects.

Our Roblox games our now open-source and can now be downloaded and edited at their respected game links, which you can find at our Roblox Group.

Please note that we are (very obviously) not affiliated with any of the original companies (such as Microsoft and Apple) that made these operating systems. 100% UNOFFICIAL AND UNLICENSED, BABY!!!!!!!!!!!
